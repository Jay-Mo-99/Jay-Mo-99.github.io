# Time Complexity of Array

## What is the time complexity?

- Measure how fast and how slow an operation of the data structure of the algorithm is.
- Measure the steps that they take.

# Memory

- Non-volatile memory → The hard drive: Still save the memory turn off the computer
- Volatile memory → The RAM(Random Access Memory): If you can’t save the memory turn off the computer
- 
- Reading data from RAM is faster than from a Hard Drive.

- Because RAM can access the data randomly
    - RAM has several rooms and its memory address.
    - If the user approaches this memory address, we can approach the value which address contains

## Assign the array to RAM.

- Assign several boxes next to each other in the RAM.
- The computer knows what the maximum length of the array is and ***where the memory started.***
    - JS/Python is handling both of these  → Potential that slower speed than other language.

# Operation of Array

## Reading

![image.png](image%202.png)

- Approach the index(memory address) to read the value of that address.
- For this Random access feature, it is best to read a lot of values.

## Searching

![image.png](image%203.png)

![image.png](image%204.png)

- ***Linear Search(선형검색)***
    - Approach all the items on the array for search the specific value (Index 0 ~ Index length -1)
- Spend a lot of time, Not that fast.

## Insert(Add)

- Best Scenario → Add the new item in the last address of the array → Fast.
- So So case → Add the new item in the middle location of the array(We can know the index(address) → Middle Fast.
    
    ![image.png](image%207.png)
    
- Worst case
    - Add thenew item at thebeginningn of the array
        - Relocate all items to the next index, and create a new empty space for the new item.
    - Already full
        - The array has specific length, but we don’t have any space for adding a new item
        - Create the new array copy ex element and paste them.
        - Spend a lot of time

## Delete

- Best case
    - Element the last element of the array → Fast
- So So
    - Delete the medium element of the array.
    - Move forward next element in the array
- Worst case
    - Delete the first element of the array

# Static Array vs Dynamic Array

## Static Array

```c
int array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

- **Fast:** Since access time is O(1), specific index values can be quickly referenced.
- **Fixed Size:** Once the array size is set during initialization, it cannot be changed.
    
     This can lead to unnecessary memory usage or, a lack of memory.
    
- **Inefficient for Adding or Deleting Data:** Since the size is fixed
- **When to Use:** Suitable when the number of elements is clearly defined and unlikely to change.

## Dynamic Array

```cpp
std::vector<int> dynamicArray;
```

- 크기 변화 가능
- 데이터 더하거나 빼기 가능
- C++에서는 벡터, Java 는 Array List
- 길이 고정 X, 데이터 추가 유리
- 크기 변경시 성능 저하, 메모리 낭비가 심하다 → 크기를 확장할때 새로운 배열의 크기가 기존의 자동으로 두배로 커지기 때문에 오히려 낭비

- **Resizable:** Allows for adding or deleting data, making it more flexible for array management.
- **Easy to Add(Appending):** Adding data at the end of the dynamic array is O(1),
- **Insert and Remove Data:**  but inserting or deleting in the middle may take O(n).
- **Language-Specific Implementations:** For instance, C++ uses `std::vector`, and Java uses `ArrayList` for dynamic arrays.
- **Memory Waste:** When expanding, the array size typically doubles automatically, which can result in unnecessary memory usage. This may also lead to performance degradation.

# Stack

### Abstract Data Type(ADT)

- Type of the Data Structure, Just a behaviour this structure is, not existed code structure.
- Stack and Queue

### Definition

![image.png](image%209.png)

- Stack은 수직으로 쌓아올린 array
- Last in First Out(LiFo), Such as the file of the Pan Cake
- Only read, add and delete item to the top(Last element)

### Usage: Recent Activity

![image.png](image%2010.png)

- Back Button in the website, Ctrl + Z
    - Taking top of the information of the history stack

### Operations

- **push:** Adds a new element to the top of the stack. The time complexity is generally **O(1)**.
- **pop:** Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack. This time complexity of **O(1)**.
- **peek:** Checks what the top element of the stack. The time complexity is **O(1)**.

### Advantages

- Simple to implement
- Good for backtracking: It is useful in scenarios like undo functions back and forward buttons, and other backtracking problems.
- Memory management: In programming, stacks are used for function call management, where local variables and function states are stored in the call stack.
- 장점: 간단해, 백 트래킹 문제 확인에 유리(뒤로가기 앞으로가기 이런거에도 유리), 메모리 관리에 유리
- 단점:  데이터 접근에 제한이 있어, 중간에 있는 데이터 접근하려면 top element들을 싹 처리해줘야해, 다양한 데이터 처리에 어려움

### Disadvantages

- **Limited data access:** Since the stack follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, accessing elements in the middle is not possible directly. To reach a specific element, you would have to pop all the elements above it.
- **Not ideal for diverse data and ordered data handling:** In cases where order matters (like a queue) or frequent access to specific indices is needed, stacks are not suitable.
